# --- Location API Settings ---

# List of free IP geolocation APIs to identify server countries.
# The system tries APIs in order from top to bottom (first = highest priority).
# If one API fails or is rate-limited, the system automatically tries the next one.
#
# HOW TO ADD AN API:
# Simply add the domain name or full URL. Examples:
#   freeipapi.com
#   ip-api.com
#   https://ipapi.co
#   api.iplocation.net
#
# The system automatically detects the correct API format and endpoint.
# No API key is required for the APIs listed below.
#
# RECOMMENDED FREE APIs (ranked by reliability and rate limits):
#
# 1. freeipapi.com - 60 requests/minute, very fast, no registration
# 2. ip-api.com - 45 requests/minute, very reliable, widely used
# 3. ipapi.co - 1000 requests/day (~30k/month), good accuracy
# 4. ipwhois.app - 10000 requests/month, decent speed
# 5. api.iplocation.net - unlimited, fast, accurate
